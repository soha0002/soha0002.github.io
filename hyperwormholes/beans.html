        A baked bean bandit is emptying cans of the good stuff all over a village in a sticky reign of terror. The mystery vandal has been covering doorsteps, homes and cars with the famous orange sauce. Cops are now urging anyone with information to spill the beans. The shocking turn of events is taking place in the pretty countryside village of Wonersh in Surrey.

        It is home to just over 3,000 people, with residents understandably rocked by the recent incidents. A Surrey Police spokesperson said: ‘Local officers have received reports of incidents in Wonersh where beans and other <a href="https://evog0001.github.io/ratfood.html"> food </a> has been poured onto residents’ front doors and cars overnight.‘The victims are understandably distressed by this unacceptable behaviour.’

        They added: ‘Local officers will be patrolling the area and keeping an eye out for anything suspicious.’ Officers also shared some snaps of the messy crime scenes. In one picture, four empty cans of Heinz beans are discarded near a doorstep studded with little orange beans. While another shows a grey <a href="index.html"> car </a> with sauce dribbling down the driver’s window, leaving an unsightly orange smudge.

        However, some residents have seen the funny side while urging police to catch the criminals. One person wrote online: ‘Hope you catch those horrendous criminals! Otherwise the house prices in Wonersh will plunge!’ Another joked: ‘What half-baked idiots would do this? I hope they get thrown in the can! ‘Absolutely Heinzous crime.’
