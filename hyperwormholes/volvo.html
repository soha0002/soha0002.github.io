        Stockholm is a city with a long and interesting history, and although it is the largest city in Scandinavia, it retains a peaceful atmosphere with wonderful Swedish architecture and the natural beauty of the surrounding sea. Stockholm is an incredibly pretty city. It is made up of fourteen islands and has countless things to see and do between the museums, parks, and historic streets & buildings.

        Avibrant, colourful city of contrasts, forward-thinking and ultra-modern, breaking boundaries and setting standards, set among centuries-old buildings and rich history. Stockholm is a buzzing hive of activity, a beacon of change, peace, love and acceptance. Streets adorned with quaint cafe‚Äôs and Fika-loving locals, modern design and ancient architecture. It is, without a doubt, a feast for the senses and a city well worth exploring. More than that, the Swedish culture is one well-worth experiencing first-hand.

        Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, encompasses 14 islands and more than 50 bridges on an extensive Baltic Sea archipelago. The cobblestone streets and ochre-colored buildings of Gamla Stan (the old town) are home to the 13th-century Storkyrkan Cathedral, the Kungliga Slottet Royal Palace and the Nobel Museum, which focuses on the Nobel Prize. Ferries and sightseeing boats shuttle passengers between the islands.

        Bakers in Stockholm certainly know what to do with a sack of flour and a splash of water. They work with all possible kinds of flours (graham, einkorn, buckwheat ‚Äì you name it!) and they throw different ingredients to the mix (sprouted rye and fennel seeds, anyone?) They don‚Äôt shun the single-celled fungi that yeast are. And so, every day, shelves in bakeries across the city bend under the weight of crusty sourdough loaves, buns crunchy from seeds, dense rye breads and croissants so flaky that it takes barely a gentle bite to have your chin covered in buttery crumbs.
