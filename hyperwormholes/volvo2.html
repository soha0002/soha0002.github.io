          For my last post on Stockholm, I‚Äôd like to focus on what I always associate with Sweden ‚Äì baked goods, excellent baked goods. These excellent baked goods made up my breakfasts and my fikas and were eaten on the hoof, in cafes, at tourist attractions.My first fika was at Vete-Katten, a well-preserved labyrinth of a coffee shop in the centre of Stockholm.

          There was, of course, coffee (apparently Swedes have the 2nd or 3rd highest coffee consumption per capita) and an excellent kardemummabulle (cardamom bun). And their Prinsesstarta! I never really understood this cake, thinking the green layer on top was all a bit odd but my goodness was it ever good. The lovely thin layer of green marzipan held together the lightest freshest whipped cream and a most delicate sponge. It‚Äôs a popular cafe and you may struggle to find a seat on the weekend but it‚Äôs worth the wait!

          From Fabrique, the Swedish chain with outlets in <a href="mini.html">London</a> (hooray!), an outstanding flaky bun with rhubarb and hazelnuts, and an excellent kardemummabulle. And I discovered the mandelbulle (almond bun) sold at Br√∂d & Salt, another bakery chain found throughout Stockholm. Imagine that cardamom dough rolled up with frangipane, sliced and then topped with a biscuit topping with lots of whole almonds. Yes, it was amazing.

          I loved Stockholm! I loved its food and its beautiful surroundings and its <a href="https://jtyl0002.github.io/wormholes/flower.html">flowers</a> and everything. I‚Äôm hoping to visit again in the future, bringing Blai with me this time, and he‚Äôs keen to go too after seeing all my photos. Thanks to everyone who sent information about Stockholm, its restaurants, and Eurovision, which was on the weekend I was there!
