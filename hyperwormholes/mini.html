        As part II of our trip, we took the Eurostar over to London! Read part I of our trip here. Minus a bit of a delay, I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy taking the <a href="eurostar.html"> Eurostar </a> between Paris and London was. I should also mention that we were able to bring our Insidr cell phone with us to London with no issue switching between countries. We used it as our phone and mobile hotspot for the rest of the trip!

        When we arrived in London, we went and dropped our stuff off at our Airbnb, and promptly headed to the nearest pub (across the street) for some food. The <a href="nightlife.html">bar</a>tender quickly explained to us some very important advice: ‚Äúchips‚Äù are like American steak fries. <a href="index.html">‚ú®</a>‚ÄúFries‚Äù are like thin, McDonald‚Äôs fries. So there you have it!

        We were so excited to start exploring that we went straight to Bond Street for some window shopping! We made our way through the shops there, and ended up right in Soho. I wanted to visit this store called the House of MinaLima‚Äì it‚Äôs the storefront for the graphic designers of the Harry Potter movie series! Every bit of HP paraphernalia from the movies, from the Daily Prophet covers to the Hogwarts letters Harry receives, was created by the two designers. We spent forever in here talking to the staff and looking at the posters. It was pretty spectacular.

        Later that afternoon we ended up seeing a movie (HA!). We both hadn‚Äôt see The Avengers yet and really needed to give our feet a break. I know, I know. WE WERE ON VACATION, OKAY? We had a late dinner at Gymkhana, which is a really unique and contemporary Indian restaurant. The service was great and the place was packed! And the food was really good.
