        It was past midnight. I should have been in bed, but there I was, stepping out of the U-Bahn stop at Warschauer Straße. I trekked through the snow, the dark, empty streets reminding me that I was alone. I approached an expanse of barbed wire and empty footpath, littered with broken glass and <a href="https://alyn0002.github.io/wormholes/cigarette.html">cigarette</a> butts. I looked up to see a large concrete building contrasted against the night sky: I had arrived at the Berghain.

        Upon coming to Berlin, I had inevitably heard about the famous club Berghain. My faint idea of it was that it was some sort of techno mecca that seems to be as hard to get into as college and threw wild parties that lasted for days at a time. I became intrigued by its exclusivity and dreamed of what lay behind its thick iron doors. I sifted through the countless guides <a href="https://berghaintrainer.com/">online</a> that claim to know something (or nothing) about how to get in. 
      </div>
  
      
      <div class="left speechB">
        Around 45 minutes later (almost 4 a.m.), I reached the front of the line. Then it was my turn to face my fate. This time around, my heart wasn’t beating out of my chest. I was just shivering uncontrollably and hoping that they wouldn’t think I was having a seizure. With a stoic look on my face (my actual resting face), I stood still and silent, barely making eye contact, waiting to be judged. Time froze, though probably only 7 seconds passed. The bouncer ushered me in with his right hand without gibing me a second glance. Finally. Acceptance. I felt the overwhelming sense of relief, approval, and euphoria wash over me.

        I had my ID checked, my body patted down, and three stickers placed over my phone cameras.

      <div class="right speechC">
        “No Fotos, ja?” the security lady said sternly.

      <div class="left speechC">
        “Ja,” I replied. I knew the rules.
      </div>

      <div class="centrespeech speechB">
        Then I paid the 18€ cover to get in. A stamp on my right hand, and I was ready to roll.
