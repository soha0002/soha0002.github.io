        From anti-vaxxers to QAnon, we look at how misinformation spreads online – and the lives it disrupts.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are lots of reasons people give for not getting a COVID-19 vaccine – lack of access, personal choice or general distrust. Then there are the conspiracy theories, which have spiked during the pandemic. The World Health Organization calls it <span style="color:blue" >“an infodemic”,</span> where dangerous medical misinformation sows chaos and mistrust. So how do conspiracy theories spread? Reporter and episode host Ike Sriskandarajah unravels the history of the lie that there is a tiny microchip in each vial of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Then reporter Stan Alcorn digs into the origins of “Stop the Steal.” In 2016, it was the name of a right-wing activist group that spread the idea that the United States’ democratic institutions were rigged against Donald Trump. In 2020, it re-emerged as a hashtag attached to baseless Republican claims of voter fraud, gained huge audiences on social media and became a rallying cry among the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol building Jan. 6. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We close the show with a conversation between a mother and son who are divided over conspiracy theories. Lucy Concepcion is one of an estimated 75 million Americans who believe the results of the presidential election were illegitimate. She also believes in QAnon. Her son, BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha, believes in facts. Samaha describes what it’s like when someone you love believes in an elaborate series of lies, and we listen in as he and his mom discuss their complicated and loving relationship.

          From The Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Ike Sriskandarajah filling in for Al Letson.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          I started working at Reveal in 2015, back before this was a weekly radio show. And I can count on my hands the number of times Al has stepped away from the mic, so you know this is for a good reason. You’ll get to hear the new investigation he’s reporting in a few months. And in the meantime, I get to tell you a story.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Today, we’re going to start back on October 2nd, 2020. President Trump just tested positive for the coronavirus. The country is accelerating into its third wave and vaccines are still months away. But pandemic be damned, here in New York City, you still have to move your car for street sweeping. So early one morning, I walk out of my building with everyone else parked on the Friday side of our narrow street. I get in the car and I turn on my radio…
        </div>
        <div class="left">Good morning USA.</div>
        <div class="right">… to The Breakfast Club.</div>
        <div class="left">Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.</div>
        <div class="right">Why don’t [crosstalk] we start our show that way?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          This is Charlamagne tha God. Peace to the planet. It’s Friday.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          The Breakfast Club is a popular radio show based in New York. It’s syndicated across the country and gets eight million listeners a month and millions more watch online. One day, it’s Redman promoting a 420 rap battle. The day before that, it’s Pete Buttigieg talking infrastructure. And this morning, in October, Charlamagne tha God, the most outspoken of the three hosts, is riffing on the president’s positive test.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          What does Charlamagne think? I have a few thoughts. First of all, I’m not about to be happy that Trump and Melania got corona. I would never celebrate something happening to a person that I don’t want to happen to me and mine.
        </div>
        <div class="right">And I’m listening along, kind of nodding my head like, “I wonder what is going to happen to the president? He’s in his 70s. He’s overweight.” And as I’m thinking this, Charlamagne takes the conversation in a direct I don’t see coming.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          But, the conspiracy theorist in me simply doesn’t believe it. I really just feel like this is a ploy to change the headlines, or it’s a ploy to get y’all to line up to take that goddamn value menu vaccine that they going to be rolling out, because he going to be the first person to act like he taking it and be the hero. And the next thing you know, all of y’all are going to have microchips in y’all booties right in time for goddamn Thanksgiving.
        </div>
        <div class="right">Microchips in the vaccine.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Millions of people line up to get it and boom, microchip implants for all of y’all.
        </div>
        <div class="right">Before we go any further, we got to say, there is no microchip in any of the vaccines. And maybe Charlamagne is assuming that his listeners know this theory is laughably bogus when he says…

        </div>
        <div class="left">
          And next thing you know, you’re going to have a microchip in your (beep).
        </div>
        <div class="right">But by the fourth time he repeats it, I’m wondering, “We all know he’s joking, right?”
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          There are lots of reasons people give for not getting a COVID vaccine, lack of access, personal choice, general distrust. Then there are the conspiracy theories, which have spiked during the pandemic.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          The World Health Organization calls it an infodemic, where dangerous medical information sows chaos and mistrust and makes the pandemic even worse. Recently, it’s been so bad that the WHO has named vaccine hesitancy one of the top 10 threats to global health.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          In the US, the end of this pandemic feels so close, literally an arm’s length away, but only if enough arms get the vaccine.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Today’s show is about conspiracy theories, lies and misinformation. We’re looking at three different stories about how lies spread and the toll they take.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Up first, does hearing a bogus theory like the one I heard in my car about microchips, does that actually influence people? I called a doctor who works at the closest hospital to where I heard that conspiracy on the radio, Dr. Jordan Dow.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          So for the past four years, I’ve been in residency at Kings County Hospital/SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn.
        </div>
        <div class="right">Dr. Dow works in a major public ER that serves mostly black and Latino patients. And when we spoke earlier this year, he’d been getting a lot of questions about the COVID vaccines.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Yeah, almost regularly, almost daily, and then also, nursing staff who comes up and asks, “Is this safe?” And other staff in the hospital just says, “Is it safe?”
        </div>
        <div class="right">Whenever those questions came up with patients or staff, Dr. Dow listened.

        </div>
        <div class="left">
          I first have to hear all their concerns. I have to let them get it all out, because I don’t know what of my concerns are irrelevant to them. So I just want to hear, what are the main things that keep you from doing this?
        </div>
        <div class="right">Patients would tell him, they’re suspicious of how quickly the drug was developed, the financial interest of drug companies. All of that, Dr. Dow was happy to discuss.

        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Appropriate skepticism, I think, is essential.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          No, it’s not skepticism. It’s actual distrust.
        </div>
        <div class="right">Charlamagne tha God on The Breakfast Club earlier this year takes it even further.

        </div>
        <div class="left">
          And I’m sick of people acting like the distrust Black people have for that vaccine isn’t warranted. I’ve never seen this government be in a rush to combat any other ailments in the Black community, not the racial wealth gap, not police brutality, not lack of health care, mental and physical, but all of a sudden, y’all want to come in and save us with this vaccine. It’s been too much malpractice done to melanated people for us to just all of a sudden trust y’all in regards to this vaccine. I don’t care what Black person y’all get to take it publicly.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          And I’m sick of people acting like the distrust Black people have for that vaccine isn’t warranted.

        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Charlamagne was unconvinced by PSA’s of Black celebrities getting the vaccine. Dr. Dow, who is Black and Latino, also was unmoved by vaccine testimonials. He had to vet the trial studies and the peer reviewed data himself before he was ready to trust the vaccine enough to take it, which eventually he did. Dr. Dow is open about his own distrust of the medical system. But, there is another kind of skepticism he has less patience for.
        </div>
        <div class="left">The things I’m sick of hearing are that, we’re putting a 5G microchip in with the swab.
        </div>
        <div class="right">This is a variant on the microchip vaccine conspiracy theory I had heard. Dr. Dow’s patients worried that a tiny piece of tracking technology was at the end of the little COVID test Q-tip going up their nose. And apparently, this conspiracy theory came up a lot.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          So I had to swab hundreds of people, and 20% of them thought I was putting something in their nose. I would just look at them like, “This is not the time to play. Can we please move on?”
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But, lots of Americans are having a hard time moving on from this very concern. A poll found that more than one in four adults said, they don’t know if the COVID vaccines contain a tracking microchip. That’s nearly 70 million Americans.
        </div>
        <div class="left">This one in particular, this microchip one, is just big. It’s everywhere.

        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Joan Donovan is the research director of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard. She’s a leading expert on disinformation. And early in the pandemic, she studied the spread of this lie.
        </div>
        <div class="left">It touches all different kinds of folks and it keeps coming up in these different ways.
        </div>
        <div class="right">The microchip conspiracy theory has infected communities, urban and rural, Black and white, liberal and conservative. And she tracked the lie all the way back to where it started.
        </div>
        <div class="left">The microchip stuff comes out of this very nascent conspiracy.</div>
        <div class="right">So let’s do a little conspiracy contact tracing. Like so many conspiracy theories, this one is based on a tiny kernel of truth. On March 18th, 2020, Bill Gates logged onto a Reddit AMA to answer people’s questions about the new, surging pandemic. And in that chat, he predicted, one day, we would all carry a digital passport for our health records, not a microchip, but some kind of E-vaccination card that we would show to get into places.
        </div>
        <div class="right">The next day, a website that calls itself, “The first and only news source on bio hacking,” wrote about Gates’ comment. I talked with their admin who goes by the name [Cipher]. And this is going to get weird, Cipher belongs to a community of bio hackers who advocate for human implantable microchips. They also have them. And they gave their blog post the untrue headline, “Bill Gates Will Use Microchip Implants to Fight Coronavirus.” But, even these futurists couldn’t have predicted what would happen next.
        </div>
        <div class="left">Hello, this Adam with Law of Liberty. I want to share an article with you today. Look at this, “Bill Gates Will Use Microchip Implants to Fight Coronavirus.” That’s right, Bill Gates.
        </div>
        <div class="right">Just two days after the blog post, a Baptist pastor from Jacksonville, Florida makes a biblical case.
        </div>
        <div class="left">It’s not just an implantable ID system. It’s literally worshiping this beast, which is the Antichrist that gives glory to the dragon, which is the Devil. That is Satan. So this mark of Satan that Bill Gates warns about, hey, it’s true.
        </div>
        <div class="right">It’s not. But, this video with its incomprehensible logic quickly gets 1.6 million views, in order of magnitude, more than anything the pastor’s account had ever received. A few days later…
        </div>
        <div class="left">Bill Gates invents this chip. And they just announced that they are considering using it.
        </div>
        <div class="right">… a New York comedian uploads this.
        </div>
        <div class="left">Now, once they have that chip in your body, who knows what they’re going to do. Right?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          A day later, we know for sure, it’s a plandemic.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          A survivalist joins in.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Bill Gates doesn’t want anybody moving around in the country or abroad without a certificate verifying that they’ve been vaccinated.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Tell me if you’ve heard this one, “A pastor, a comedian, a doomsday prepper all walk into a…” Well, that joke is not worth repeating. But people repeat this lie all over YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          But it’s really a story about Roger Stone.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Again, Joan Donovan, disinformation researcher at Harvard.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Which is just Roger Stone being Roger Stone.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Roger Stone, political advisor to Donald Trump who was convicted of repeatedly lying to Congress makes a guest appearance on the Joe Piscopo Show, AM 970 New York City.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Roger Stone is standing by. Joe Piscopo on the radio.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Joe Piscopo is an early SNL star who now hosts one of those incredibly long, daily talk shows. And it’s here on April 13th, 2020 during the fourth hour of the Joe Piscopo Show that Roger Stone becomes on of the super-spreaders this lie has been waiting for.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          First of all, thank you. Roger Stone, the legend, on the phone with Joe Piscopo.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Piscopo barely tees up Stone with a question about the virus before Stone lays in.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Here is how I try to break it down.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Please.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Wow! Wow!
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          I have conservative friends who say, it’s ridiculous. I have other who say, it’s absolute. But, here is what I do know for certain, he and other globalists are definitely using it in a drive for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people, so we can tell, quote unquote, “whether you’ve been tested.” Do you know what I say, Joe?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          What’s that?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Over my dead body. Over my dead body.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          [inaudible].
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Later that afternoon, The New York Post runs the headline, “Roger Stone: Bill Gates May Have Created Coronavirus to Microchip People.”
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          And then it just went totally brr on Facebook.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Brr is disinformation expert slang for the moment a rumor jumps from the fringe into popular consciousness. The New York Post’s story and the Baptist pastor’s video are liked and shared all over Facebook.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          And we don’t really know how it’s developed since then.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Since April of 2020, the lie keeps spreading and mutating…
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          A recent Microsoft patent 060606, aka 666, involves another implantable device for the [crosstalk].

          [foreign language hh:mm:ss]. [crosstalk].
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But the viral lie at the center stays the same.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Where this ends, and I know this sounds like the stuff of madness and 12 months ago, you would never hear this come out of my mouth, but this does end with a little tiny microchip in our hands, so that it’s easier to get in the pub and out.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          When I reached out to YouTube to ask how they moderate medical misinformation, no one would talk to me. Instead, a representative sent a statement saying, they’ve removed 900,000 misleading videos about the coronavirus, including 30,000 videos just about vaccines. YouTube even has a policy banning videos that claim there are microchips in the vaccine. But in April, when I was reporting this story, all the YouTubes you heard were still live, including the video that helped spark this whole conspiracy theory, the one from that Baptist pastor in Florida.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Embedded quantum dots into the body to keep your medical records. And this is part of a larger agenda. This is part of-
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          It had racked up nearly two million views. So I sent YouTube a link asking why this viral video was still active? 48 hours later and more than a year after it first went up, YouTube decided to take it down. In total, the company removed six out of the seven videos I asked about. The comedian got to stay. TikTok removed five out of six videos I asked about. And Facebook says, it removed 16 million pieces of content that violated its COVID and vaccine misinformation policy, and says, it slapped warning labels on 167 million pieces of content rated false by their fact checking partners. But even that jaw dropping amount is just a fraction of what experts say is out there.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          The Center for Countering Digital Hate, an international NGO that studies online misinformation, found that platforms failed to act on 95% of COVID and vaccine-related misinformation reported to them. So when people go looking for information about the vaccine, there is a chance that the first thing they run into might be a lie.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          It’s a life and death decision.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          And Joan Donovan says, “That could sway whether or not people choose to get vaccinated.”

          We don’t know how many people are not showing up to the doctors because they believe this, but the ones that do feel vulnerable, and that vulnerability is totally artificial.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          If the platforms are Petri dishes of bad information, whose paying attention to those lies and trying to inoculate the public with timely, accurate, real information? Polls show, many Americans haven’t made up their minds yet about the vaccine. And 20% say, they refuse to get it. How much of that has to do with misinformation? And what does that mean for the end of the pandemic? I called one more doctor.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          So I’m Lee Riley. I’m professor of infectious disease at the School of Public Health at the University of California Berkeley, professor and head of the division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Dr. Riley says something I hadn’t heard anyone else say before. And in a way, it’s good news.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          I’m not that concerned about the 20% of the people who end up not receiving the vaccine, because many of these people will get naturally infected. And if they get naturally infected, they’ll become immune.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Unfortunately, it’s not good news for everybody.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          If they continue to resist getting the vaccine, yes, they’ll get sick. Many of them will get hospitalized. And some of them will actually die.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Well, it sounds a little cold to the people who that are no longer with us.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Well, this is their belief system and they made the decision to not get the vaccine, so they can exercise their personal liberty. This is what happens, nature always takes care of itself.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But, our information ecosystem doesn’t. If you want to know what the government is or rather, isn’t doing about vaccine misinformation, read our [tech] story. You can find it on The Verge or our site revealnews.org.

          I want you to picture a scene, hundreds of people standing on the granite steps of the Capitol building.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          I want you to say, Stop the Steal.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Stop the Steal.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But, it’s the Capitol building of Colorado in April 2016.
        </div>
        <div class="left">Do you want your freedom back?</div>
        <div class="left">Yes.</div>
        <div class="right">
          Also worth noting, this crowd is angry at the Republican Party. And the steal they want to stop is the nomination of anyone other than Donald Trump for president.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Stop the Steal.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          This was the beginning of Stop the Steal. And it wasn’t just a catchy chant.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          So we’ve got these pamphlets here. Go to stopthesteal.org, and I think you’ll understand that this is the group that’s going to be key in making sure Colorado’s voices are heard.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          From the start, Stop the Steal was a group of activists and a set of tactics. In Colorado, it started at the caucus that Saturday when Ted Cruz won all the state’s Republican delegates. Donald Trump start complaining.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          The bosses and the establishment and the people that shouldn’t have this power took all of the power away from the voters.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Voters took it out on the local establishment boss, State GOP Chairman Steve House.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Every single day when he would say something, my phone would ring with somebody else, “I hope your daughters are burned in cages and raped by extremists,” and, “We’re on the way to your house in Colorado right now.”
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Stop the Steal was trying to harness that anger Trump had whipped up and pointed at the upcoming Republican Convention in Cleveland to get the party to pick Trump through a show of force.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Come to Cleveland. March on Cleveland.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          You might recognize that voice from earlier in the show when he was talking about Bill Gates putting microchips in the vaccine, Stop the Steal founder, Mr. Roger Stone.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          We will disclose the hotels and the room numbers of those delegates who are directly involved in the steal. We urge you to visit their hotel and find them.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          This plan to storm the 2016 Republican Convention, it didn’t happen. And it was largely forgotten because Trump won the nomination fair and square. But, Stop the Steal didn’t stop there.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Reveal’s Stan Alcorn has been tracing the history of these three little words, and he’s going to tell you what happened next. Here’s Stan.
        </div>
        <div class="bar"></div>
        <div class="right">
          As soon as he won the nomination, Donald Trump started saying the 2016 election was going to be rigged, and stopthesteal.org explained exactly how. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were going to reprogram Diebold voting machines and also flood the polls with quote, “illegals.” To stop them, Stop the Steal was calling for an army of volunteers to show up at key precincts on Election Day looking for fraud.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Whatever happened, Laura Starecheski was going to cover it for Reveal by shadowing the Stop the Steal point person in Philadelphia, a Democratic city in a swing state where Trump insisted there would be voter fraud.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          As far as you could tell, what was Stop the Steal in Philadelphia in 2016, in reality?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Yeah. There did seem to be grand plans, like when you would go to the website, Stop the Steal looked like they were organizing people. But then when I was with Jack that day, it was kind of just Jack.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Jack is Jack Posobiec, a Game of Thrones blogger turned pro-Trump Twitter troll who was working with Roger Stone. On election morning, Laura caught up with him at the Philly GOP headquarters.
        </div>
        <div class="bar2"></div>
        <div class="right">
          How is your mood right now, would you say?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Oh, I’m excited. Are you kidding me? I live for this. I live for the adrenaline rush of Election Day, exposing the flagrant abuses of our democracy. It’s like Christmas morning.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          He’s basically pacing around and waiting for word that something has happened, so he can rush to the scene. And then finally, something happens, and he’s like, “Okay, it’s on.” So we jump in the car.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          As you can tell, I’ve been kind of living here.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Jack’s driving and this other guy jumps in the backseat.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Okay. I’m going to call the lawyer. And then I’m going to call a bunch of media people.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Can you identify yourself?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Albert Eisenberg, Philly Republican Party.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          What’s your role?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Communications lead. Do you have any napkins or anything? I don’t want to drip [crosstalk].
        </div>
        <div class="middle">
          It’s sounds like he’s eating a sandwich.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Yeah, Albert had a hoagie, and he’s cramming this hoagie in his mouth.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Hey, Dennis. We are headed to you know. I think this is going to be the story of the day for us, so we’re really going to push this.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          And Albert is freaking out.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          You can prep her, just relax her. And keep the message sharp and tight.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          He’s so excited.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          That first thing, my name is [Brittany], I forget her last name, Foreman, and today I witnessed voter fraud, period. Awesome.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          And he starts making all of these calls…
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Hey, [Ev]. This is Albert Eisenberg. We spoke pretty recently.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          … trying to get other media to come to this polling place where we’re headed.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Hey. We got a really hot issue of voter fraud up in Winfield, and we’re headed there now. I want to tell you [crosstalk].
        </div>
        <div class="middle">
          Meanwhile, Jack is using his phone to talk to his followers on Twitter’s live stream video app, Periscope.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          So hey, this is Jack Posobiec. I’ve got another report of voter fraud. Al is working to get some of the more traditional media, but we’re covering it live because that’s how we roll around here.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          At the time it seemed clear that they were trying to discredit the election before the election happened, just finding ways to de-legitimize it. And I guess I was just like, “This is so weird. What are they going to say when we get there?” I was really curious to see how Jack would filter what was happening to his followers, and would it work?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          There is Brittany.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          So we pull up.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          [inaudible].
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          And there is this woman, Brittany Foreman. Can you tell me what happened? I’m a reporter for Reveal Radio.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Tell both us [inaudible].
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Yes. From the time I came in, it was a issue with the committee person. [crosstalk].
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          And to be honest with you, it was a little confusing and hard to figure out what exactly the complaint was. At one point, it seemed like she was saying…
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Then I witness him actually go, and-
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          There was someone with the Democratic Party who was going into voting booths with people.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          … and offered to assist the elderly inside the voting both.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But then it was like, is that person just helping?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          I don’t know what he was doing. I don’t know what he did in there. He could have been hitting the buttons for all I know.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Interestingly, Jack didn’t seem that curious about her or what the account was. And Jack goes off to the side just talking to his followers.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          He’s working together, complete collusion.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          And I was like, “Oh.”
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Allowing him to get away with murder, in terms of politics.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          It’s like, go there, be there in person, set it up so that something could have happened, and then you just say that it happened, and you were there. And so, it seems more legitimate to people.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          That’s why I’m Periscoping this. That’s why we’ve got other media out here. We’ve got other media coming. And we’re going to expose this for what it is and let people know. So at some point, I would like to-
        </div>
        <div class="bar2"></div>
        <div class="right">
          Meanwhile, across town, the phones are ringing at the hotline set up to deal with allegations like this one. Every call gets a response from the Philadelphia district attorney’s Election Fraud Taskforce made up of several dozen investigators and more than 60 lawyers, including Andrew Wellbrock.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          It was all run of the mill complaints. “I went to vote and my name must have been purged from the register.” “Oh, when is the last time you voted?” “1994.” “Okay, that’s why,” nothing actually alleging a crime.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          It sounds like it’s a lot of-
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Babysitting. Yeah, I mean, we are often put in the position of basically being told, we’re like the referees.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But as the day goes on, they start to hear stories that are more disturbing.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Some of the younger prosecutors started saying things like, “Hey, we’re seeing this on Twitter. We’re seeing this on Twitter.”
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          It’s like the players are taking their complaints to the fans instead of the refs. The Philly GOP tweets that a voting machine is defaulting to Clinton when voting for Trump. And they tweet out a video of Brittany Foreman, #VoterFraudIllegal. It opens with Albert’s line from the car.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          My name is Brittany Foreman. And today, I witnessed voter fraud.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          There are people screaming at the internet about all of these things that are happening in Philadelphia, but we weren’t getting phone calls. And at 2:00 PM, we did a big press conference. We have no founded complaints of intimidation, no founded complaints of voter fraud. And we basically said, “Philly GOP please call us, if you have these complaints and we can address them.” And at 2:00 PM they stopped tweeting. So we asked them to put up or shut up, and they decided to shut up rather than provide us with evidence.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          But the internet does not shut up. The Brittany Foreman video is re-tweeted by people like Jack Posobiec, and ultimately watched hundreds of thousands of times. It’s picked up by websites like Infowars and Breitbart with headlines like, “Philly Poll Watcher Says She Personally Witnessed Voter Fraud.” But still, all this is a one day story. Trump wins the election that night and most people move on, including Andrew.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          To me, it came and went, and that was that.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          Until four years later when Andrew would run the Philadelphia Election Task Force for the 2020 election.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Here we are now, just hours from Election Day 2020.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          The Trump campaign calling for thousands to monitor what the president insists is an election rigged against him.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Go into the polls and watch very carefully, because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          When we got that hotline up is when we realized that things were going to be very different. We’re getting calls from guys in Texas, “They’re stealing the vote. They’re putting banners on the buildings.” We’re like, “Sir, that was taken down right when the polls opened at 7:00 AM.” “You’re lying to me.” “All right, what do you want me to do? It’s not there.”
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          At some point, they start getting calls about a video going around on Twitter.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          You’re not letting me in.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          [crosstalk] No.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          It’s 30 seconds long and a middle aged white man demanding to be let into a funeral parlor where people are voting.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          [crosstalk] call somebody.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          I have a citywide watcher’s certificate.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Well, it’s not for this location.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          No, it’s not [crosstalk].
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          The tweet says, “A poll watcher in Philly was just wrongfully prevented from entering the polling place,” which is technically accurate. The poll watcher, Gary Feldman, should have been let in.
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          Had Gary Feldman called us to say that, we would have said, “Yes, he is allowed to be there,” but that’s not what they wanted. They wanted a show. They wanted that headline that you referred to.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          So he didn’t make a complaint?
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          No, I mean, that was the guy with deja vu of 2016. It was the same deal all over again.

        An infodemic is too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak. It causes confusion and risk-taking behaviours that can harm health. It also leads to mistrust in health authorities and undermines the public health response. An infodemic can intensify or lengthen outbreaks when people are unsure about what they need to do to protect their health and the health of people around them. With growing digitization – an expansion of social media and internet use – information can spread more rapidly. This can help to more quickly fill information voids but can also amplify harmful messages. <br> <br> Infodemic management is the systematic use of risk- and evidence-based analysis and approaches to manage the infodemic and reduce its impact on health behaviours during health emergencies. <br> <br> Infodemic management aims to enable good health practices through 4 types of activities: <br> <br> Listening to community concerns and questions <br> <br> Promoting understanding of risk and health expert advice <br> <br> Building resilience to misinformation <br> <br> Engaging and empowering communities to take positive action

        Algorithmic decision-making is becoming more common every day. Increasingly, important decisions that affect people’s lives are governed by datasets that are too big for an individual to process. People have become accustomed to algorithms making all manner of recommendations, from products to buy, to songs to listen to, to social network connections. But, algorithms are not just recommending, they are also being used to make big decisions about people’s lives. Among many applications, algorithms are used to: • Sort résumés for job applications; • Allocate social services; • Decide who sees advertisements for open positions, housing, and products; • Decide who should be promoted or fired; • Estimate a person’s risk of committing crimes or the length of a prison term; • Assess and allocate insurance and benefits; • Obtain and determine credit; and • Rank and curate news and information in search engines. While algorithmic decision making can offer benefits in terms of speed, efficiency, and even fairness, there is a common misconception that algorithms automatically result in unbiased decisions. While it may appear like algorithms are unbiased calculations because they take in objective points of reference and provide a standard outcome, there remain many problems with those inputs and the outputs. As Frank Pasquale, law professor at the University of Maryland, points out, algorithmic decision-making is “black boxed,” which means that while we may know what goes into the computer for processing and what the outcome is, there are currently no external auditing systems or regulations for assessing what happens to the data during processing.2 Algorithms are attractive because they promise neutrality in decision making—they take in data and deliver results. But algorithms are not “neutral.” In the words of mathematician Cathy O’Neil, an algorithm is an “opinion embedded in mathematics.”3 And like opinions, all algorithms are different. Some algorithms privilege a certain group of people over another. O’Neil argues that across a range of occupations, human decision makers are being encouraged to defer to software systems even when there is evidence that a system is making incorrect, unjust, or harmful decisions. When an algorithm’s output results in unfairness, we refer to it as bias. Bias can find its way into an algorithm in many ways. It can be created through the social context where an algorithm is created, as a result of technical constraints, or by the way the algorithm is used in practice.4 When an algorithm is being created, it is structured by the values of its designer, which might not be neutral. And after an algorithm is created, it must be trained—fed large amounts of data on past decisions—to teach it how to make future decisions. If that training data is itself biased, the algorithm can inherit that bias. For these reasons and others, decisions made by computer are not fundamentally more logical and unbiased than decisions made by people. Black-boxed algorithms can unfairly limit opportunities, restrict services, and even produce “technological redlining.” As Safiya Noble, professor of communication at University of Southern California, writes, technological redlining occurs when algorithms produce inequitable outcomes and replicate known inequalities, leading to the systematic exclusion of Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans.5 Technological redlining occurs because we have no control over how data is used to profile us. If bias exists in the data, it is replicated in the outcome. Without enforceable mechanisms of transparency, auditing, and accountability, little can be known about how algorithmic decision-making limits or impedes civil rights. Noble writes, “technological redlining is a form of digital data discrimination, which uses our digital identities and activities to bolster inequality and oppression. It is often enacted without our knowledge, through our digital engagements, which become part of algorithmic, automated, and artificially intelligent sorting mechanisms that can either target or exclude us. It is a fundamental dimension of generating, sustaining, or deepening racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination, and it is centrally tied to the distribution of goods and services in society, like education, housing, and other human and civil rights. Technological redlining is closely tied to longstanding practices of ‘redlining,’ which have been consistently defined as illegal by the United States Congress, but which are increasingly elusive because of their digital deployments through online, internet-based software and platforms, including exclusion from, and control over, individual participation and representation in digital systems.”6 Important examples of technological redlining were uncovered by ProPublica, who showed how Facebook’s targeted advertising system allowed for discrimination by race and age.7 These decisions embedded in design have significant ramifications for those who are already marginalised. In this memo, we begin by showcasing one example to illustrate how racial bias manifests in an algorithmic system. We then address the trade-offs between and debates about algorithms and accountability across several key ethical dimensions: fairness and bias; opacity and transparency; the repurposing of data and algorithms; lack of standards for auditing; power and control; as well as trust and expertise. From there, we provide an overview of algorithmic accountability by highlighting how news coverage and self-governance have further exacerbated problems related to unfair, unethical, and possibly illegal applications of algorithmic systems.

        Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance—operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond—understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century. In the Fall of 2017, Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble joined the faculty of the University of Southern California (USC) Annenberg School of Communication. Previously, she was an assistant professor in the Department of Information Studies in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA where she held appointments in the Departments of African American Studies, Gender Studies, and Education. She is a partner inStratelligence, a firm that specializes in research on information and data science challenges, and is a co-founder of theInformation Ethics & Equity Institute, which provides training for organizations committed to transforming their information management practices toward more just, ethical, and equitable outcomes. She is the recipient of a Hellman Fellowship and the UCLA Early Career Award.
