        Online, there is such a large amount of information from <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; "> different </span> sources that it can be hard to know who or what to believe.

          From anti-vaxxers to QAnon, we look at how misinformation spreads online – and the lives it disrupts.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are lots of reasons people give for not getting a COVID-19 vaccine – lack of access, personal choice or general distrust. Then there are the conspiracy theories, which have spiked during the pandemic. The World Health Organization calls it <span style="color:blue" >“an infodemic”,</span> where dangerous medical misinformation sows chaos and mistrust. So how do conspiracy theories spread? Reporter and episode host Ike Sriskandarajah unravels the history of the lie that there is a tiny microchip in each vial of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Then reporter Stan Alcorn digs into the origins of “Stop the Steal.” In 2016, it was the name of a right-wing activist group that spread the idea that the United States’ democratic institutions were rigged against Donald Trump. In 2020, it re-emerged as a hashtag attached to baseless Republican claims of voter fraud, gained huge audiences on social media and became a rallying cry among the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol building Jan. 6. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We close the show with a conversation between a mother and son who are divided over conspiracy theories. Lucy Concepcion is one of an estimated 75 million Americans who believe the results of the presidential election were illegitimate. She also believes in QAnon. Her son, BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha, believes in facts. Samaha describes what it’s like when someone you love believes in an elaborate series of lies, and we listen in as he and his mom discuss their complicated and loving relationship.

            From The Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Ike Sriskandarajah filling in for Al Letson.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            I started working at Reveal in 2015, back before this was a weekly radio show. And I can count on my hands the number of times Al has stepped away from the mic, so you know this is for a good reason. You’ll get to hear the new investigation he’s reporting in a few months. And in the meantime, I get to tell you a story.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Today, we’re going to start back on October 2nd, 2020. President Trump just tested positive for the coronavirus. The country is accelerating into its third wave and vaccines are still months away. But pandemic be damned, here in New York City, you still have to move your car for street sweeping. So early one morning, I walk out of my building with everyone else parked on the Friday side of our narrow street. I get in the car and I turn on my radio…
          </div>
          <div class="left">Good morning USA.</div>
          <div class="right">… to The Breakfast Club.</div>
          <div class="left">Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.</div>
          <div class="right">Why don’t [crosstalk] we start our show that way?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            This is Charlamagne tha God. Peace to the planet. It’s Friday.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The Breakfast Club is a popular radio show based in New York. It’s syndicated across the country and gets eight million listeners a month and millions more watch online. One day, it’s Redman promoting a 420 rap battle. The day before that, it’s Pete Buttigieg talking infrastructure. And this morning, in October, Charlamagne tha God, the most outspoken of the three hosts, is riffing on the president’s positive test.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            What does Charlamagne think? I have a few thoughts. First of all, I’m not about to be happy that Trump and Melania got corona. I would never celebrate something happening to a person that I don’t want to happen to me and mine.
          </div>
          <div class="right">And I’m listening along, kind of nodding my head like, “I wonder what is going to happen to the president? He’s in his 70s. He’s overweight.” And as I’m thinking this, Charlamagne takes the conversation in a direct I don’t see coming.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            But, the conspiracy theorist in me simply doesn’t believe it. I really just feel like this is a ploy to change the headlines, or it’s a ploy to get y’all to line up to take that goddamn value menu vaccine that they going to be rolling out, because he going to be the first person to act like he taking it and be the hero. And the next thing you know, all of y’all are going to have microchips in y’all booties right in time for goddamn Thanksgiving.
          </div>
          <div class="right">Microchips in the vaccine.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Millions of people line up to get it and boom, microchip implants for all of y’all.
          </div>
          <div class="right">Before we go any further, we got to say, there is no microchip in any of the vaccines. And maybe Charlamagne is assuming that his listeners know this theory is laughably bogus when he says…

          </div>
          <div class="left">
            And next thing you know, you’re going to have a microchip in your (beep).
          </div>
          <div class="right">But by the fourth time he repeats it, I’m wondering, “We all know he’s joking, right?”
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            There are lots of reasons people give for not getting a COVID vaccine, lack of access, personal choice, general distrust. Then there are the conspiracy theories, which have spiked during the pandemic.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The World Health Organization calls it an infodemic, where dangerous medical information sows chaos and mistrust and makes the pandemic even worse. Recently, it’s been so bad that the WHO has named vaccine hesitancy one of the top 10 threats to global health.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            In the US, the end of this pandemic feels so close, literally an arm’s length away, but only if enough arms get the vaccine.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Today’s show is about conspiracy theories, lies and misinformation. We’re looking at three different stories about how lies spread and the toll they take.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Up first, does hearing a bogus theory like the one I heard in my car about microchips, does that actually influence people? I called a doctor who works at the closest hospital to where I heard that conspiracy on the radio, Dr. Jordan Dow.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So for the past four years, I’ve been in residency at Kings County Hospital/SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn.
          </div>
          <div class="right">Dr. Dow works in a major public ER that serves mostly black and Latino patients. And when we spoke earlier this year, he’d been getting a lot of questions about the COVID vaccines.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Yeah, almost regularly, almost daily, and then also, nursing staff who comes up and asks, “Is this safe?” And other staff in the hospital just says, “Is it safe?”
          </div>
          <div class="right">Whenever those questions came up with patients or staff, Dr. Dow listened.

          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I first have to hear all their concerns. I have to let them get it all out, because I don’t know what of my concerns are irrelevant to them. So I just want to hear, what are the main things that keep you from doing this?
          </div>
          <div class="right">Patients would tell him, they’re suspicious of how quickly the drug was developed, the financial interest of drug companies. All of that, Dr. Dow was happy to discuss.

          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Appropriate skepticism, I think, is essential.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            No, it’s not skepticism. It’s actual distrust.
          </div>
          <div class="right">Charlamagne tha God on The Breakfast Club earlier this year takes it even further.

          </div>
          <div class="left">
            And I’m sick of people acting like the distrust Black people have for that vaccine isn’t warranted. I’ve never seen this government be in a rush to combat any other ailments in the Black community, not the racial wealth gap, not police brutality, not lack of health care, mental and physical, but all of a sudden, y’all want to come in and save us with this vaccine. It’s been too much malpractice done to melanated people for us to just all of a sudden trust y’all in regards to this vaccine. I don’t care what Black person y’all get to take it publicly.
          </div>
          <div class="left">

          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Charlamagne was unconvinced by PSA’s of Black celebrities getting the vaccine. Dr. Dow, who is Black and Latino, also was unmoved by vaccine testimonials. He had to vet the trial studies and the peer reviewed data himself before he was ready to trust the vaccine enough to take it, which eventually he did. Dr. Dow is open about his own distrust of the medical system. But, there is another kind of skepticism he has less patience for.
          </div>
          <div class="left">The things I’m sick of hearing are that, we’re putting a 5G microchip in with the swab.
          </div>
          <div class="right">This is a variant on the microchip vaccine conspiracy theory I had heard. Dr. Dow’s patients worried that a tiny piece of tracking technology was at the end of the little COVID test Q-tip going up their nose. And apparently, this conspiracy theory came up a lot.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So I had to swab hundreds of people, and 20% of them thought I was putting something in their nose. I would just look at them like, “This is not the time to play. Can we please move on?”
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But, lots of Americans are having a hard time moving on from this very concern. A poll found that more than one in four adults said, they don’t know if the COVID vaccines contain a tracking microchip. That’s nearly 70 million Americans.
          </div>
          <div class="left">This one in particular, this microchip one, is just big. It’s everywhere.

          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Joan Donovan is the research director of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard. She’s a leading expert on disinformation. And early in the pandemic, she studied the spread of this lie.
          </div>
          <div class="left">It touches all different kinds of folks and it keeps coming up in these different ways.
          </div>
          <div class="right">The microchip conspiracy theory has infected communities, urban and rural, Black and white, liberal and conservative. And she tracked the lie all the way back to where it started.
          </div>
          <div class="left">The microchip stuff comes out of this very nascent conspiracy.</div>
          <div class="right">So let’s do a little conspiracy contact tracing. Like so many conspiracy theories, this one is based on a tiny kernel of truth. On March 18th, 2020, Bill Gates logged onto a Reddit AMA to answer people’s questions about the new, surging pandemic. And in that chat, he predicted, one day, we would all carry a digital passport for our health records, not a microchip, but some kind of E-vaccination card that we would show to get into places.
          </div>
          <div class="right">The next day, a website that calls itself, “The first and only news source on bio hacking,” wrote about Gates’ comment. I talked with their admin who goes by the name [Cipher]. And this is going to get weird, Cipher belongs to a community of bio hackers who advocate for human implantable microchips. They also have them. And they gave their blog post the untrue headline, “Bill Gates Will Use Microchip Implants to Fight Coronavirus.” But, even these futurists couldn’t have predicted what would happen next.
          </div>
          <div class="left">Hello, this Adam with Law of Liberty. I want to share an article with you today. Look at this, “Bill Gates Will Use Microchip Implants to Fight Coronavirus.” That’s right, Bill Gates.
          </div>
          <div class="right">Just two days after the blog post, a Baptist pastor from Jacksonville, Florida makes a biblical case.
          </div>
          <div class="left">It’s not just an implantable ID system. It’s literally worshiping this beast, which is the Antichrist that gives glory to the dragon, which is the Devil. That is Satan. So this mark of Satan that Bill Gates warns about, hey, it’s true.
          </div>
          <div class="right">It’s not. But, this video with its incomprehensible logic quickly gets 1.6 million views, in order of magnitude, more than anything the pastor’s account had ever received. A few days later…
          </div>
          <div class="left">Bill Gates invents this chip. And they just announced that they are considering using it.
          </div>
          <div class="right">… a New York comedian uploads this.
          </div>
          <div class="left">Now, once they have that chip in your body, who knows what they’re going to do. Right?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            A day later, we know for sure, it’s a plandemic.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            A survivalist joins in.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Bill Gates doesn’t want anybody moving around in the country or abroad without a certificate verifying that they’ve been vaccinated.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Tell me if you’ve heard this one, “A pastor, a comedian, a doomsday prepper all walk into a…” Well, that joke is not worth repeating. But people repeat this lie all over YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            But it’s really a story about Roger Stone.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Again, Joan Donovan, disinformation researcher at Harvard.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Which is just Roger Stone being Roger Stone.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Roger Stone, political advisor to Donald Trump who was convicted of repeatedly lying to Congress makes a guest appearance on the Joe Piscopo Show, AM 970 New York City.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Roger Stone is standing by. Joe Piscopo on the radio.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Joe Piscopo is an early SNL star who now hosts one of those incredibly long, daily talk shows. And it’s here on April 13th, 2020 during the fourth hour of the Joe Piscopo Show that Roger Stone becomes on of the super-spreaders this lie has been waiting for.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            First of all, thank you. Roger Stone, the legend, on the phone with Joe Piscopo.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Piscopo barely tees up Stone with a question about the virus before Stone lays in.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Here is how I try to break it down.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Please.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Wow! Wow!
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I have conservative friends who say, it’s ridiculous. I have other who say, it’s absolute. But, here is what I do know for certain, he and other globalists are definitely using it in a drive for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people, so we can tell, quote unquote, “whether you’ve been tested.” Do you know what I say, Joe?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            What’s that?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Over my dead body. Over my dead body.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            [inaudible].
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Later that afternoon, The New York Post runs the headline, “Roger Stone: Bill Gates May Have Created Coronavirus to Microchip People.”
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            And then it just went totally brr on Facebook.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Brr is disinformation expert slang for the moment a rumor jumps from the fringe into popular consciousness. The New York Post’s story and the Baptist pastor’s video are liked and shared all over Facebook.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            And we don’t really know how it’s developed since then.

            Where this ends, and I know this sounds like the stuff of madness and 12 months ago, you would never hear this come out of my mouth, but this does end with a little tiny microchip in our hands, so that it’s easier to get in the pub and out.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            When I reached out to YouTube to ask how they moderate medical misinformation, no one would talk to me. Instead, a representative sent a statement saying, they’ve removed 900,000 misleading videos about the coronavirus, including 30,000 videos just about vaccines. YouTube even has a policy banning videos that claim there are microchips in the vaccine. But in April, when I was reporting this story, all the YouTubes you heard were still live, including the video that helped spark this whole conspiracy theory, the one from that Baptist pastor in Florida.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Embedded quantum dots into the body to keep your medical records. And this is part of a larger agenda. This is part of-
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            It had racked up nearly two million views. So I sent YouTube a link asking why this viral video was still active? 48 hours later and more than a year after it first went up, YouTube decided to take it down. In total, the company removed six out of the seven videos I asked about. The comedian got to stay. TikTok removed five out of six videos I asked about. And Facebook says, it removed 16 million pieces of content that violated its COVID and vaccine misinformation policy, and says, it slapped warning labels on 167 million pieces of content rated false by their fact checking partners. But even that jaw dropping amount is just a fraction of what experts say is out there.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The Center for Countering Digital Hate, an international NGO that studies online misinformation, found that platforms failed to act on 95% of COVID and vaccine-related misinformation reported to them. So when people go looking for information about the vaccine, there is a chance that the first thing they run into might be a lie.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            It’s a life and death decision.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And Joan Donovan says, “That could sway whether or not people choose to get vaccinated.”
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            We don’t know how many people are not showing up to the doctors because they believe this, but the ones that do feel vulnerable, and that vulnerability is totally artificial.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            If the platforms are Petri dishes of bad information, whose paying attention to those lies and trying to inoculate the public with timely, accurate, real information? Polls show, many Americans haven’t made up their minds yet about the vaccine. And 20% say, they refuse to get it. How much of that has to do with misinformation? And what does that mean for the end of the pandemic? I called one more doctor.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So I’m Lee Riley. I’m professor of infectious disease at the School of Public Health at the University of California Berkeley, professor and head of the division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Dr. Riley says something I hadn’t heard anyone else say before. And in a way, it’s good news.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I’m not that concerned about the 20% of the people who end up not receiving the vaccine, because many of these people will get naturally infected. And if they get naturally infected, they’ll become immune.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Unfortunately, it’s not good news for everybody.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            If they continue to resist getting the vaccine, yes, they’ll get sick. Many of them will get hospitalized. And some of them will actually die.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Well, it sounds a little cold to the people who that are no longer with us.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Well, this is their belief system and they made the decision to not get the vaccine, so they can exercise their personal liberty. This is what happens, nature always takes care of itself.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But, our information ecosystem doesn’t. If you want to know what the government is or rather, isn’t doing about vaccine misinformation, read our [tech] story. You can find it on The Verge or our site revealnews.org.

            I want you to picture a scene, hundreds of people standing on the granite steps of the Capitol building.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I want you to say, Stop the Steal.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Stop the Steal.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But, it’s the Capitol building of Colorado in April 2016.
          </div>
          <div class="left">Do you want your freedom back?</div>
          <div class="left">Yes.</div>
          <div class="right">
            Also worth noting, this crowd is angry at the Republican Party. And the steal they want to stop is the nomination of anyone other than Donald Trump for president.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Stop the Steal.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            This was the beginning of Stop the Steal. And it wasn’t just a catchy chant.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So we’ve got these pamphlets here. Go to stopthesteal.org, and I think you’ll understand that this is the group that’s going to be key in making sure Colorado’s voices are heard.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            From the start, Stop the Steal was a group of activists and a set of tactics. In Colorado, it started at the caucus that Saturday when Ted Cruz won all the state’s Republican delegates. Donald Trump start complaining.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            The bosses and the establishment and the people that shouldn’t have this power took all of the power away from the voters.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Voters took it out on the local establishment boss, State GOP Chairman Steve House.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Every single day when he would say something, my phone would ring with somebody else, “I hope your daughters are burned in cages and raped by extremists,” and, “We’re on the way to your house in Colorado right now.”
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Stop the Steal was trying to harness that anger Trump had whipped up and pointed at the upcoming Republican Convention in Cleveland to get the party to pick Trump through a show of force.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Come to Cleveland. March on Cleveland.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            You might recognize that voice from earlier in the show when he was talking about Bill Gates putting microchips in the vaccine, Stop the Steal founder, Mr. Roger Stone.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            We will disclose the hotels and the room numbers of those delegates who are directly involved in the steal. We urge you to visit their hotel and find them.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            This plan to storm the 2016 Republican Convention, it didn’t happen. And it was largely forgotten because Trump won the nomination fair and square. But, Stop the Steal didn’t stop there.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Reveal’s Stan Alcorn has been tracing the history of these three little words, and he’s going to tell you what happened next. Here’s Stan.
          </div>
          <div class="bar"></div>
          <div class="right">
            As soon as he won the nomination, Donald Trump started saying the 2016 election was going to be rigged, and stopthesteal.org explained exactly how. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were going to reprogram Diebold voting machines and also flood the polls with quote, “illegals.” To stop them, Stop the Steal was calling for an army of volunteers to show up at key precincts on Election Day looking for fraud.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Whatever happened, Laura Starecheski was going to cover it for Reveal by shadowing the Stop the Steal point person in Philadelphia, a Democratic city in a swing state where Trump insisted there would be voter fraud.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            As far as you could tell, what was Stop the Steal in Philadelphia in 2016, in reality?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Yeah. There did seem to be grand plans, like when you would go to the website, Stop the Steal looked like they were organizing people. But then when I was with Jack that day, it was kind of just Jack.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Jack is Jack Posobiec, a Game of Thrones blogger turned pro-Trump Twitter troll who was working with Roger Stone. On election morning, Laura caught up with him at the Philly GOP headquarters.
          </div>
          <div class="bar2"></div>
          <div class="right">
            How is your mood right now, would you say?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Oh, I’m excited. Are you kidding me? I live for this. I live for the adrenaline rush of Election Day, exposing the flagrant abuses of our democracy. It’s like Christmas morning.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            He’s basically pacing around and waiting for word that something has happened, so he can rush to the scene. And then finally, something happens, and he’s like, “Okay, it’s on.” So we jump in the car.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            As you can tell, I’ve been kind of living here.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Jack’s driving and this other guy jumps in the backseat.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Okay. I’m going to call the lawyer. And then I’m going to call a bunch of media people.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Can you identify yourself?
          </div>

            Albert Eisenberg, Philly Republican Party.

            It’s sounds like he’s eating a sandwich.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Yeah, Albert had a hoagie, and he’s cramming this hoagie in his mouth.

            Hey, Dennis. We are headed to you know. I think this is going to be the story of the day for us, so we’re really going to push this.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And Albert is freaking out.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            You can prep her, just relax her. And keep the message sharp and tight.
          </div>

            He’s so excited.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            That first thing, my name is [Brittany], I forget her last name, Foreman, and today I witnessed voter fraud, period. Awesome.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And he starts making all of these calls…
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Hey, [Ev]. This is Albert Eisenberg. We spoke pretty recently.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            … trying to get other media to come to this polling place where we’re headed.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Hey. We got a really hot issue of voter fraud up in Winfield, and we’re headed there now. I want to tell you [crosstalk].
          </div>
          <div class="middle">
            Meanwhile, Jack is using his phone to talk to his followers on Twitter’s live stream video app, Periscope.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So hey, this is Jack Posobiec. I’ve got another report of voter fraud. Al is working to get some of the more traditional media, but we’re covering it live because that’s how we roll around here.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            At the time it seemed clear that they were trying to discredit the election before the election happened, just finding ways to de-legitimize it. And I guess I was just like, “This is so weird. What are they going to say when we get there?” I was really curious to see how Jack would filter what was happening to his followers, and would it work?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            There is Brittany.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            So we pull up.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            [inaudible].
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And there is this woman, Brittany Foreman. Can you tell me what happened? I’m a reporter for Reveal Radio.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Tell both us [inaudible].
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Yes. From the time I came in, it was a issue with the committee person. [crosstalk].
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And to be honest with you, it was a little confusing and hard to figure out what exactly the complaint was. At one point, it seemed like she was saying…
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Then I witness him actually go, and-
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            There was someone with the Democratic Party who was going into voting booths with people.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            … and offered to assist the elderly inside the voting both.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But then it was like, is that person just helping?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I don’t know what he was doing. I don’t know what he did in there. He could have been hitting the buttons for all I know.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Interestingly, Jack didn’t seem that curious about her or what the account was. And Jack goes off to the side just talking to his followers.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            He’s working together, complete collusion.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And I was like, “Oh.”
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Allowing him to get away with murder, in terms of politics.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            It’s like, go there, be there in person, set it up so that something could have happened, and then you just say that it happened, and you were there. And so, it seems more legitimate to people.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            That’s why I’m Periscoping this. That’s why we’ve got other media out here. We’ve got other media coming. And we’re going to expose this for what it is and let people know. So at some point, I would like to-
          </div>
          <div class="bar2"></div>
          <div class="right">
            Meanwhile, across town, the phones are ringing at the hotline set up to deal with allegations like this one. Every call gets a response from the Philadelphia district attorney’s Election Fraud Taskforce made up of several dozen investigators and more than 60 lawyers, including Andrew Wellbrock.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            It was all run of the mill complaints. “I went to vote and my name must have been purged from the register.” “Oh, when is the last time you voted?” “1994.” “Okay, that’s why,” nothing actually alleging a crime.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            It sounds like it’s a lot of-
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Babysitting. Yeah, I mean, we are often put in the position of basically being told, we’re like the referees.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But as the day goes on, they start to hear stories that are more disturbing.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Some of the younger prosecutors started saying things like, “Hey, we’re seeing this on Twitter. We’re seeing this on Twitter.”
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            It’s like the players are taking their complaints to the fans instead of the refs. The Philly GOP tweets that a voting machine is defaulting to Clinton when voting for Trump. And they tweet out a video of Brittany Foreman, #VoterFraudIllegal. It opens with Albert’s line from the car.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            My name is Brittany Foreman. And today, I witnessed voter fraud.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            There are people screaming at the internet about all of these things that are happening in Philadelphia, but we weren’t getting phone calls. And at 2:00 PM, we did a big press conference. We have no founded complaints of intimidation, no founded complaints of voter fraud. And we basically said, “Philly GOP please call us, if you have these complaints and we can address them.” And at 2:00 PM they stopped tweeting. So we asked them to put up or shut up, and they decided to shut up rather than provide us with evidence.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But the internet does not shut up. The Brittany Foreman video is re-tweeted by people like Jack Posobiec, and ultimately watched hundreds of thousands of times. It’s picked up by websites like Infowars and Breitbart with headlines like, “Philly Poll Watcher Says She Personally Witnessed Voter Fraud.” But still, all this is a one day story. Trump wins the election that night and most people move on, including Andrew.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            To me, it came and went, and that was that.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Until four years later when Andrew would run the Philadelphia Election Task Force for the 2020 election.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Here we are now, just hours from Election Day 2020.

          <div class="left">
            Go into the polls and watch very carefully, because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            When we got that hotline up is when we realized that things were going to be very different. We’re getting calls from guys in Texas, “They’re stealing the vote. They’re putting banners on the buildings.” We’re like, “Sir, that was taken down right when the polls opened at 7:00 AM.” “You’re lying to me.” “All right, what do you want me to do? It’s not there.”
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            At some point, they start getting calls about a video going around on Twitter.
          </div>
          <div class="left">

            The tweet says, “A poll watcher in Philly was just wrongfully prevented from entering the polling place,” which is technically accurate. The poll watcher, Gary Feldman, should have been let in.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Had Gary Feldman called us to say that, we would have said, “Yes, he is allowed to be there,” but that’s not what they wanted. They wanted a show. They wanted that headline that you referred to.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            So he didn’t make a complaint?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            No, I mean, that was the guy with deja vu of 2016. It was the same deal all over again.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But, saying it was the same deal as 2016 is kind of like saying two fires are the same, when one is a candle and the other is the fuse of a bomb.

            One of the many groups monitoring and countering election misinformation that day was First Draft News. Laura Garcia in their UK office had the early shift.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So actually the first thing that I remember really digging into on that day is that video.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The tweet doesn’t give a location other than Philadelphia. So Laura tries to look for clues in the video itself.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Just because someone says it’s Philly doesn’t mean it’s Philly. [crosstalk].
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But, by the time she tracks it down, the tweet is already going viral.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            It’s one of those worst case scenario things, which is [inaudible]. It’s starting to pop up on Instagram and then somewhere else across different influencers who were talking about it. And we then started to see it in headlines.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The lead story on Breitbart was, “The steal is on in Pennsylvania. Poll watchers denied access.” And then there is the little three word hashtag at the end of the tweet.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            What did you think when you first saw those words, Stop the Steal?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            “Oh, man. It’s such a good hashtag.” It’s short. It’s punchy. It’s active. It tells you as an audience that there is something that you can do about it. Plus, an alliteration in there, which is always nice.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The Stop the Steal hashtag was being tweeted more than 10,000 times an hour at its Election Day peak, attached to all kinds of different conspiracy theories. But, it was all kicked off by this one video of poll watcher Gary Feldman, with a push from someone who met up with Gary later that day to do a Periscope.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            So I’m here live. And I’m here with Gary Feldman, who has gone viral this morning a couple [crosstalk].
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Yes, that is Jack Posobiec. He went from running the Philly Stop the Steal operation out of his car in 2016 to being able to kick start the nationwide Stop the Steal hashtag in 2020.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            People don’t realize how centered he’s become in the world of right wing media. He is a huge star.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Michael Edison Hayden wrote an investigative series about Jack’s rise for the Southern Poverty Law Center, where he’s a reporter and spokesperson. Jack’s opening act was at the dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, where Jack showed up in a Hillary Clinton mask carrying a sign that said, “Blacks Are Super Predators.”
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            That’s how he burst out onto the scene. And then from there, the next time he does a live streaming stunt, it is Pizzagate.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            He live streamed from a pizzeria…
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Comet Pizza. Here we go.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            … to play up the conspiracy theory that Democrats were running a child sex ring there.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            We’re dealing with some high level stuff here, guys. We’re doing some very high level stuff.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            As Michael and others have documented, Jack worked with white supremacists, [doxed] an alleged victim of sexual abuse, and routinely pushed disinformation. But, each controversy just brought him more attention, more followers, and no real negative repercussions from Twitter or from the right wing media.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I think on the right, social media is viewed as this battle zone. And they view Jack Posobiec, I think, as a guy who just fights relentlessly. And they don’t care that he fights dirty.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Especially, because of the way he fights for Donald Trump. After Trump praised both sides at the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Jack asked in a tweet why the mainstream media wasn’t instead covering gun violence in Chicago?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I’m looking at what I’m seeing out there.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Then he went on live stream.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Huh, Trump just re-tweeted me. Dear.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Yes.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Apparently, the president just re-tweeted me. Can you get your phone or something? I didn’t know this.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Oh my gosh.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            There you go, folks. There you go. There it is. There it is.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Whoa, [crosstalk].
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            At the time of the 2020 election, Jack was a correspondent at the One America News Network. And he had more than one million Twitter followers, including President Trump and his two adult sons.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            What does it say that Jack has been able to achieve that level of legitimacy?
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Or at least the appearance of legitimacy.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Yeah.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I think what it says is that the right in this country, they have created an entirely bizarro ecosystem of media and commentary. If you look at some of the figures who’ve promoted Stop the Steal, for example, of which Jack Posobiec was one of them, I mean, these are people with no discernible credentials whatsoever outside of social media manipulation.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Not only had Jack become a star, he was part of a whole new Trump media galaxy.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Four of the top institutions studying social media misinformation got together for the 2020 election as the Election Integrity Project. And they put out a list of the most influential repeat spreaders of false and misleading stories on Twitter. The top 20 included Breitbart News, Fox’s Sean Hannity, and right between Donald Trump himself and an account with the user name Catturd2 was Jack Posobiec. Jack declined to comment on this, by the way, other than to say he shares things his followers might find interesting.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Anyways, after Election Day, the viral lies that these and other influencers were sharing got increasingly detached from reality. In Philadelphia, the first big new allegation Andrew Wellbrock had to deal with was a claim that Republican poll watchers couldn’t see the counting of the votes.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            We didn’t get any calls about it, but we saw it online. And was it Corey Lewandowski was outside of the convention center yelling that into a megaphone? So I walked into the room, “Hey, who is a Republican poll watcher?” I think five, six people raised their hands. “Can you see?” “Yeah.” “All right. My work here is done.” And I left.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            But, Andrew’s work was just beginning. He’s now prosecuting two men who drove up to the vote count from Virginia with an assault rifle in the back of their Hummer after one of them texted, “Going to PA. Have a truckload of fake ballots we’re going to raid.”
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            There is a disconnect from reality that will continue to surprise me always.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The men were initially let out on bail until they showed up at the US Capitol on January 6th.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            They are motivated because they think democracy is being stolen, their rights are being curtailed.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            I called up Joan Donovan, the misinformation expert from Harvard.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            This is a reason why people go to war.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            And these false beliefs, they didn’t stop with the attack on the Capitol. A majority of Republicans still think Trump won the election. Joan thinks that’s in part due to being saturated with misinformation repeatedly in post after post and redundantly on platform after platform, Facebook, Twitter, TV, radio.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            And the repetition plus the redundancy starts to take on the character of something that must be true because a lot of people are saying it. And that’s really what media manipulators and disinformers bank on. That’s what their strategic advantage is.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Joan see misinformation as a feature of social media, not a bug. And she thinks dealing with it is a problem a lot more people need to actively be working on in the federal government and also at the social media companies themselves.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            If these companies do not start to take bold positions and action on authoritarians especially, then we’re going to be in serious, serious problems, because we’re on 10 years in to the social media era.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Joan thinks another five years down the road we’ve been traveling could lead to a really dark place, but also she thinks it’s not too late to pull the emergency brake and head somewhere different.

            Roughly a third of American adults believe that the results of the 2020 presidential election were fraudulent. That’s about 75 million people who believe the lie that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. Lucy [Concepcion] is one of them.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I like Trump. I see the conservative agenda that he brings to the country. And I know that there are corrupt politicians that is fighting and all that stuff, but then to you, it seems like it’s a conspiracy.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            The you Lucy is talking to is her son, Albert Samaha, an investigative reporter at BuzzFeed where he first wrote about their strained relationship.

          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Well, the challenge may be that my ideas are different from yours. You know that I believe in QAnon. Right?

            Lucy treads in the world of QAnon. Albert works in the world of verifiable information.

          <div class="left">
            You think you’re right, but to me, I think not. So I think the challenge that you have is to convince me that you’re right. Well, then, knowing your mom, who is very strong in her faith, it will be hard to convince.
          </div>
          <div class="middle">
            It’s a dynamic that so many American families are trying to navigate. What do you do when someone you love believes in an elaborate series of lies? So we asked Albert to tell us how he and his mom do it? How do they manage to stay a part of each other’s lives while living in fundamentally different realities?

            When I was growing up, I was an only child. She was a single mom. So it’s just us two against the world at every step. It was my voice that she gave most weight to, whether it was, should I keep dating this guy, or should I take this job or that job? We were paddling in the same direction, and I valued the same things she valued.

            Anything else? That’s it. Nothing else matter except that.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            Yeah, for me, because I mean, it’s just, I think you were trained differently from where I was coming from, what I learned about politics.

          <div class="right">
            She grew up in the Philippines and Ferdinand Marcos, who was president at the time, declares martial law in 1972. The presidency becomes a dictatorship. She grew up believing that America was the most stable place in the world.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            I think like a lot of immigrants, her American dream was rooted in the opportunities of her children. I think she also, at least for a time, achieved the American dream that she wouldn’t say was primary, which was her own success, because there was a moment in the mid 2000s when we were flying super high. She was a real estate agent and she was selling a dozen houses a year. She bought a Benz. And then like millions of other people, my mom was hit really hard by the housing crash. And when the market collapsed, she had to sell my childhood home at a loss. And she has been trying to claw her way back since.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            So this is now around 2010. As the financial troubles were happening, the voices she trusted were calling Obama a Muslim and un-American and making up all this disinformation about him. She was beginning to turn to more and more of these far right wing sites that were popping up on the internet.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            My friends, we’re all conservatives, right, so we share the same ideas. But then, to you, it seems like it’s a conspiracy. And I don’t blame you. It’s just because you don’t see it. I know that, especially as a journalist, you have to see evidence. Okay. My friends, we believe what is being said.
          </div>

            She had grown up in a society in the Philippines under a dictatorship where she always believed that there were dirty machinations happening on behind the curtains.

          <div class="right">
            By 2018, she starts to tell me about these posts online that claim to be written by a high level government operative with Q level clearance. And this person claims this sprawling, global, child trafficking cabal.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            People will be shocked. People will be shocked when they find out about Oprah Winfrey, a lot of Hollywood people, a lot of politicians. I mean, people just don’t realize-
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            Trump is battling this deep state. He’s got this grand plan to arrest everybody involved. And that’s what this is about.

          <div class="left">
            The reason why it’s not being exposed yet is because a lot of people, they might just go crazy if they find out, “What? Tom Hanks, he drinks adrenochrome? This guy is a pedophilia. He’s supposed to be a good person.”

            Especially as an investigative reporter where my entire vocation comes down to proving the truth to other people, the fact that I couldn’t convince my mom of what I found to be obvious truths was very frustrating.

          <div class="left">
            How has it felt to navigate these past few years, our relationship?
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            It’s been difficult, I think, because we’re both pretty hardheaded. I think, we’re frustrated by the same things, which is that there is nothing we can say to convince the other person.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            I feel right now, it has come to a point that whatever. Okay, if that’s what you feel, that’s fine, I still love you. I cannot convince you. I think the [inaudible] you.
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            I shifted my measure of success away from having to persuade her and to more so try to understand her. And it occurred to me that this was also a much more productive approach for our relationship.
          </div>
          <div class="left">
            At least our, sometimes, well, argument, it’s not even arguments anymore, but when we share whatever beliefs we have, this can just be the spice of life. It just makes life better or more fun than if there wasn’t anything to talk about. So I think it’s okay.
          </div>
          <div class="middle">
            Albert and Lucy have spent more than a decade arguing, trying to convince each other what’s true and what’s not. So at this point, they joke about it, about whether or not the alleged cabal of blood drinking Hollywood sex traffickers will be brought to justice.

          <div class="right">

            An infodemic is too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak. It causes confusion and risk-taking behaviours that can harm health. It also leads to mistrust in health authorities and undermines the public health response. An infodemic can intensify or lengthen outbreaks when people are unsure about what they need to do to protect their health and the health of people around them. With growing digitization – an expansion of social media and internet use – information can spread more rapidly. This can help to more quickly fill information voids but can also amplify harmful messages.

            Take the incipient Internet of things — the invasion of cheap sensors, chips, and wirelessly chattering mobile media into the objects in our everyday world. The nineties vision of “cyberspace" that partly inspired TechGnosis suggested that a surreal digital otherworld lay on the far side of the looking glass screen from the meatspace we physically inhabit.
          </p>

          <p>
            But that topology is being decisively eroded by the distribution of algorithms, sensing, and communicating capabilities through addressable objects, material things that in some cases are growing extraordinarily autonomous. 
          </p>

          <p>
            There are sound reasons for these developments, which arguably will greatly increase the efficiency and power of individuals and organizations to monitor, regulate, and respond to a world spinning out of control.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            As such, the Internet of things offers consumers another Gernsback carrot, another vision of a future world where desire is instantly and transparently satisfied, where labor is offloaded onto servitors, and where we are all safely watched over by machines of love and grace. But if the social history of technology provides any insight at all — and I would not have written TechGnosis if it didn’t — this fantasy is necessarily coupled to its own shadow side.

            As in the tale of the sorcerer’s apprentice, algorithmic agents will be understood as possessing a mind of their own, or serve as proxies for invisible agents of crime or all-watching control. Phil Dick’s prophecy is here: our engineered world is “beginning to possess what the primitive sees in his environment: animation.” In other words, a kind of anxious animism, the mindframe once (wrongly) associated with the primitive origins of religion, is returning in a digitally remastered form.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Intelligent objects, drones, robots, and deeply interactive devices are multiplying the nonhuman agents with whom we will be forced to negotiate, anticipate, and dodge in order to live our lives. Sometimes remote humans will be at the helm of these artifacts, though we may not always know whether or not people are directly in the loop. But all of it — the now wireless world itself — will become data for the taking.

            One side of this new animism we already know by another name: paranoia, which will continue to remain an attractive (and arguably rational) existential option in our networked and increasingly manipulated world. Even if you set aside the all-tooreal problems of political and corporate conspiracy, the root conditions of our hypermediated existence breed “conspiracy theory.”  
          </p>
          <p>
            We live in an incredibly complicated world of reverberating feedback loops, one that is increasingly massaged by invisible algorithmic controls, behavioral economics, massive corporate and government surveillance, superwealthy agendas, and insights from half a century of mind-control ops.
          </p>  
          <p>
            It is impossible to know all the
          details and agendas of these invisible agents, so if
          we try to map their operations beyond the managed
          surface of common sense and “business-as-usual,”
          then we almost inevitably need to tap the imagination, with its shifty associative logic, as we build our
          maps and models out of such fragmentary knowledge. That’s why the intertwingled complexities
          — aided and abetted by the myopic and self-reinforcing conditions of the Internet — found even in
          the most concrete conspiracy investigations inevitably drift, as systems of discourse, towards more
          arcane possibilities. The networks of influence and
          control we construct are fabulated along a spectrum
          of possibility whose more extreme and dreamlike
          ends are effectively indistinguishable from the religious or occult imagination. JFK = UFO.

          or the evidence for false !ag operations buried in the
          nitty-gritty data glitches of major news events — all
          these disturbing and popular practices suggest an
          allegorical art of interpretation that is impossible to
          extricate from our new baroque reality, with all its
          reverberating folds of surface and depth. Paranoia’s
          networks of hidden cause not only resonate with the
          electronic networks that increasingly complicate
          and characterize our world, but suggest the ultimate Discordian twist in the plot: that the greatest
          forms of control are the stories we tell ourselves
          about control.

            We like to nerd out on culture that we
          increasingly experience as data to play with. The
          in-jokes, scuttlebutt, mash-ups, and lore-obsession of geekery allow us, therefore, to snuggle up
          to the uncanny possibilities of magic, superpowers,
          and cosmic evil without ever losing the cover story
          that makes these pleasures possible for modern
          folks: that our entertainments are “just fictions,” diversions with no ontological or real psychological
          upshot, just moves in a game.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The funny thing about games and Actions is
          that they have a weird way of bleeding into reality. Whatever else it is, the world that humans
          experience is animated with narratives, rituals,
          and roles that organize psychological experience,
          social relations, and our imaginative grasp of the
          material cosmos. The world, then, is in many ways
          a webwork of fctions, or, better yet, of stories. The
          contemporary urge to “gamify” our social and technological interactions is, in this sense, simply an
          extension of the existing games of subculture, of
          folklore, even of belief.

          <p>
            This is the secret truth of the
          history of religions: not that religions are “nothing
          more” than Actions, crafted out of sociobiological
          need or wielded by evil priests to control ignorant
          populations, but that human reality possesses an
          inherently fictional or fantastic dimension whose
          “game engine” can — and will — be organized along
          variously visionary, banal, and sinister lines. Part
          of our obsession with counterfactual genres like
          sci-fi or fantasy is not that they offer escape from
          reality — most of these genres are glum or dystopian a lot of the time anyway — but because, in
          re!ecting the “as if” character of the world, they
          are actually realer than they appear

            Pick any of the big topics of the day – Brexit, climate change or Trump’s immigration policies – and wander online. What one is likely to find is <span class='backwards'> radical </span> polarization – different groups of people living in different worlds, populated with utterly different facts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many people want to blame the “social media bubble” - a belief that everybody sorts themselves into like-minded communities and hears only like-minded views. From my perspective as a philosopher who thinks about communities and trust, this fails to get at the heart of the issue.
          </p> 

          <p>
            In my mind, the crucial issue right now isn’t what people hear, but whom people believe.
          </p>

          <p>
            My research focuses on “epistemic bubbles” and “echo chambers.” These are two distinct ideas, that people often blur together. An epistemic bubble is what happens when insiders aren’t exposed to people from the opposite side. An echo chamber is what happens when insiders come to distrust everybody on the outside.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            An epistemic bubble, for example, might form on one’s social media feed. When a person gets all their news and political arguments from Facebook and all their Facebook friends share their political views, they’re in an epistemic bubble. They hear arguments and evidence only from their side of the political spectrum. They’re never exposed to the other side’s views.An echo chamber leads its members to distrust everybody on the outside of that chamber. And that means that an insider’s trust for other insiders can grow unchecked.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Two communications scholars, Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Joseph Cappella, offered a careful analysis of the right-wing media echo chamber in their 2008 book, “The Echo Chamber.” Rush Limbaugh and the Fox News team, they said, systematically manipulated whom their followers trusted. Limbaugh presented the world as a simple binary – as a struggle only between good and evil. People were trustworthy if they were on Limbaugh’s side. Anybody on the outside was malicious and untrustworthy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          In that way, an echo chamber is a lot like a cult.
          Echo chambers isolate their members, not by cutting off their lines of communication to the world, but by changing whom they trust. And echo chambers aren’t just on the right. I’ve seen echo chambers on the left, but also on parenting forums, nutritional forums and even around exercise methods.
          In an epistemic bubble, outside voices aren’t heard. In an echo chamber, outside voices are discredited.
          </p>

          <div class="subt">

            Many experts believe that the problem of today’s polarization can be explained through epistemic bubbles.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            According to legal scholar and behavioral economist Cass Sunstein, the main cause of polarization is that internet technologies have made the world such that people don’t really run into the other side anymore. Many people get their news from social media feeds. Their feeds get filled up with people like them - who usually share their political views. Eli Pariser, online activist and chief executive of Upworthy, spotlights how the invisible algorithms behind people’s internet experience limit what they see.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, says Pariser, Google keeps track of its user’s choices and preferences, and changes its search results to suit them. It tries to give individuals what they want – so liberal users, for example, tend to get search results that point them toward liberal news sites. If the problem is bubbles, then the solution would be exposure. For Sunstein, the solution is to build more public forums, where people will run into the other side more often.
          </p>
          
          <div class="subt">
            The real problem is trust
          </div>
          
          <p>
            In my view, however, echo chambers are the real problem. New research suggests there probably aren’t any real epistemic bubbles. As a matter of fact, most people are regularly exposed to the other side. Moreover, bubbles should be easy to pop: Just expose insiders to the arguments they’ve missed.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But this doesn’t actually seem to work, in so many real-world cases. Take, for example, climate change deniers. They are fully aware of all the arguments on the other side. Often, they rattle off all the standard arguments for climate change, before dismissing them. Many of the standard climate change denial arguments involve claims that scientific institutions and mainstream media have been corrupted by malicious forces.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What’s going on, in my view, isn’t just a bubble. It’s not that people’s social media feeds are arranged so they don’t run across any scientific arguments; it’s that they’ve come to systematically distrust the institutions of science.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is an echo chamber. Echo chambers are far more entrenched and far more resistant to outside voices than epistemic bubbles. Echo chamber members have been prepared to face contrary evidence. Their echo-chambered worldview has been arranged to dismiss that evidence at its source.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            They’re not totally irrational, either. In the era of scientific specialization, people must trust doctors, statisticians, biologists, chemists, physicists, nuclear engineers and aeronautical engineers, just to go about their day. And they can’t always check with perfect accuracy whether they have put their trust in the right place. An echo chamber member, however, distrusts the standard sources. Their trust has been redirected and concentrated inside the echo chamber. To break somebody out of an echo chamber, you’d need to repair that broken trust. And that is a much harder task than simply bursting a bubble.
          </p>

      <div class="col4_2">
        An echo chamber is an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. Echo chambers can create misinformation and distort a person’s perspective so they have difficulty considering opposing viewpoints and discussing complicated topics. They’re fueled in part by confirmation bias, which is the tendency to favor info that reinforces existing beliefs.

        Algorithmic decision-making is becoming more common every day. Increasingly, important decisions that affect people’s lives are governed by datasets that are too big for an individual to process. People have become accustomed to algorithms making all manner of recommendations, from products to buy, to songs to listen to, to social network connections. But, algorithms are not just recommending, they are also being used to make big decisions about people’s lives. Among many applications, algorithms are used to: • Sort résumés for job applications; • Allocate social services; • Decide who sees advertisements for open positions, housing, and products; • Decide who should be promoted or fired; • Estimate a person’s risk of committing crimes or the length of a prison term; • Assess and allocate insurance and benefits; • Obtain and determine credit; and • Rank and curate news and information in search engines. While algorithmic decision making can offer benefits in terms of speed, efficiency, and even fairness, there is a common misconception that algorithms automatically result in unbiased decisions. While it may appear like algorithms are unbiased calculations because they take in objective points of reference and provide a standard outcome, there remain many problems with those inputs and the outputs. As Frank Pasquale, law professor at the University of Maryland, points out, algorithmic decision-making is “black boxed,” which means that while we may know what goes into the computer for processing and what the outcome is, there are currently no external auditing systems or regulations for assessing what happens to the data during processing.2 Algorithms are attractive because they promise neutrality in decision making—they take in data and deliver results. But algorithms are not “neutral.” In the words of mathematician Cathy O’Neil, an algorithm is an “opinion embedded in mathematics.”3 And like opinions, all algorithms are different. Some algorithms privilege a certain group of people over another. O’Neil argues that across a range of occupations, human decision makers are being encouraged to defer to software systems even when there is evidence that a system is making incorrect, unjust, or harmful decisions. When an algorithm’s output results in unfairness, we refer to it as bias. Bias can find its way into an algorithm in many ways. It can be created through the social context where an algorithm is created, as a result of technical constraints, or by the way the algorithm is used in practice.4 When an algorithm is being created, it is structured by the values of its designer, which might not be neutral. And after an algorithm is created, it must be trained—fed large amounts of data on past decisions—to teach it how to make future decisions. If that training data is itself biased, the algorithm can inherit that bias. For these reasons and others, decisions made by computer are not fundamentally more logical and unbiased than decisions made by people. Black-boxed algorithms can unfairly limit opportunities, restrict services, and even produce “technological redlining.” As Safiya Noble, professor of communication at University of Southern California, writes, technological redlining occurs when algorithms produce inequitable outcomes and replicate known inequalities, leading to the systematic exclusion of Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans.5 Technological redlining occurs because we have no control over how data is used to profile us. If bias exists in the data, it is replicated in the outcome. Without enforceable mechanisms of transparency, auditing, and accountability, little can be known about how algorithmic decision-making limits or impedes civil rights. Noble writes, “technological redlining is a form of digital data discrimination, which uses our digital identities and activities to bolster inequality and oppression. It is often enacted without our knowledge, through our digital engagements, which become part of algorithmic, automated, and artificially intelligent sorting mechanisms that can either target or exclude us. It is a fundamental dimension of generating, sustaining, or deepening racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination, and it is centrally tied to the distribution of goods and services in society, like education, housing, and other human and civil rights. Technological redlining is closely tied to longstanding practices of ‘redlining,’ which have been consistently defined as illegal by the United States Congress, but which are increasingly elusive because of their digital deployments through online, internet-based software and platforms, including exclusion from, and control over, individual participation and representation in digital systems.”6 Important examples of technological redlining were uncovered by ProPublica, who showed how Facebook’s targeted advertising system allowed for discrimination by race and age.7 These decisions embedded in design have significant ramifications for those who are already marginalised. In this memo, we begin by showcasing one example to illustrate how racial bias manifests in an algorithmic system. We then address the trade-offs between and debates about algorithms and accountability across several key ethical dimensions: fairness and bias; opacity and transparency; the repurposing of data and algorithms; lack of standards for auditing; power and control; as well as trust and expertise. From there, we provide an overview of algorithmic accountability by highlighting how news coverage and self-governance have further exacerbated problems related to unfair, unethical, and possibly illegal applications of algorithmic systems.

        Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance—operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond—understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century. In the Fall of 2017, Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble joined the faculty of the University of Southern California (USC) Annenberg School of Communication. Previously, she was an assistant professor in the Department of Information Studies in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA where she held appointments in the Departments of African American Studies, Gender Studies, and Education. She is a partner inStratelligence, a firm that specializes in research on information and data science challenges, and is a co-founder of theInformation Ethics & Equity Institute, which provides training for organizations committed to transforming their information management practices toward more just, ethical, and equitable outcomes. She is the recipient of a Hellman Fellowship and the UCLA Early Career Award.
