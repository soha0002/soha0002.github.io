        Berlin is served by a comprehensive and interlinked network of buses, trains, trams and ferries. Itâ€™s efficient and punctual, but not especially cheap â€“ unlike a lot of its bars, restaurants and hotels. The completion of the innercity-encircling Ringbahn in 2002 reconnected the former East and West Berlin transport systems, though it can still sometimes be complicated travelling between <a href="volvo.html">eastern</a> and western destinations. But services are usually regular and frequent, timetables can be trusted, and one ticket can be used for two hours on all legs of a journey and all forms of transport.

        The Berlin transport authority, the BVG, operates bus, U-Bahn (underground) and tram networks, and a few ferry services on the outlying lakes. The S-Bahn (overground railway) is run by its own authority, but services are integrated within the same three-zone tariff system. Zone A covers central Berlin, zone B extends out to the edge of the suburbs and zone C stretches into Brandenburg. The basic single ticket is the â‚¬2.80 Normaltarif (zones A and B). Unless going to Potsdam or Flughafen SchÃ¶nefeld, few visitors are likely to travel beyond zone B, making this in effect a flat-fare system.

        The U-Bahn network consists of ten lines and 170-plus stations. The first trains run shortly after <a href="nightlife.html"> 4am; </a> the last between midnight and 1am, except on Fridays and Saturdays when most trains run all night at 15-minute intervals. The direction of travel is indicated by the name of the last stop on the line.

        Especially useful in eastern Berlin, the S-Bahn covers long distances faster than the U-Bahn and is a more efficient means of getting to outlying areas. The Ringbahn, which circles central Berlin, was the final piece of the S-Bahn system to be renovated, though there are still disruptions here and there.
